# Machine Learning Regression Project

### Project Overview

This project is focused on applying machine learning techniques to predict a car's fuel consumption (measured in miles per gallon, **mpg**) using the `mtcars` dataset. The project adheres to the **CRISP-ML** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Machine Learning) methodology, ensuring a structured approach to data exploration, model development, evaluation, and documentation.

The primary goal is to build and evaluate regression models that accurately predict `mpg` based on various features of a car, such as weight, horsepower, and displacement.

### Dataset

- **Name**: MTCars Dataset
- **Source**: R's built-in `mtcars` dataset
- **Description**: The dataset contains data on fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 cars.

### Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset (mtcars.xlsx).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- `models/`: Trained machine learning models (optional, if applicable).
- `reports/`: Generated HTML report documenting data exploration and model results.
- `src/`: Source code for preprocessing, training, and evaluating models.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project and setup instructions.

### CRISP-ML Phases Applied

1. **Business Understanding**:
    - The goal is to predict the fuel efficiency (`mpg`) of a car based on various input features. This could have practical applications in optimizing fuel consumption or comparing the fuel efficiency of different car models.

2. **Data Understanding**:
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the relationships between the input variables (`wt`, `hp`, `disp`, etc.) and `mpg`.
    - Visualizations such as correlation matrices and scatter plots help identify key features that influence fuel efficiency.

3. **Data Preparation**:
    - Data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and features are standardized to ensure uniformity.
    - The dataset is split into training and test sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

4. **Modeling**:
    - Multiple regression models are developed:
        - **Linear Regression**
        - **Ridge Regression**
        - **Lasso Regression**
    - These models are evaluated based on key performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).

5. **Evaluation**:
    - Models are assessed based on their ability to predict `mpg` accurately. Both MSE and \( R^2 \) scores are calculated and compared.
    - A successful model will explain a high proportion of the variance in the `mpg` variable (with an \( R^2 \) close to or above 0.7) and have a low MSE.

6. **Deployment**:
    - An HTML report summarizing the results is generated using `pandas-profiling`.
    - The models and the report are made available for further analysis and future deployments.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn pandas-profiling
    ```

### Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/ml-regression-project.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd ml-regression-project
    ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the project**:
    - You can execute the Python script that handles data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, or work directly in the provided Jupyter notebooks.

5. **Generate the report**:
    - After running the code, an HTML report will be generated under the `reports/` directory.
    ```bash
    python src/regression_analysis.py
    ```

6. **View the report**:
    - Open the generated `MTCars_Report.html` file in your browser to view the results.

### Results

- The best-performing model was determined based on the lowest MSE and highest \( R^2 \).
- The report provides detailed analysis, including visualizations of feature correlations and model coefficients.

### Future Work

- **Model Improvements**: Further tuning of hyperparameters or testing more advanced algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests) can be performed.
- **Feature Engineering**: Additional features can be derived to improve the model’s performance.
- **Deployment**: If needed, the best model could be deployed as a web service or integrated into a larger application.
